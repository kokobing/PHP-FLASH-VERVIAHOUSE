      </strong></span>Vervia's New Summer Collection Sparkles</h3>
        <p class="style3"> Vervia, that Taikang Lu Shop famous for artful interiors, fancy knick-knacks and a penchant for the unusual is launching its Summer 2007 collection.</p>
          <p>The collection includes the NOCHE silky range of QBIT cubes (Vervia's own Rubic's Cube of soft furniture); new dinnerware bursting with fresh Summer colours: the fanciful POTPURRI, the zesty BENGAL BAY range and the AMAZONIA collection. Vervia's own Iris Hreinsdottir, daughter of Iceland, has created a new range of sleek pic-nic baskets for those of you who may break your French loaf in Zhongyang park under the rhodedendruns. Also there is a new line of jewelry in spicy reds, mountain greens and turquoise 每 more stylish and vibrant 每 and entirely appropriate for your wild Shanghai nights.</p>
        <p>Vervia, recently coined as the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory of Interiors, does not stop here. Check out the new range of handbags 每 more subtle than the Winter collection 每 with a touch of Kyoto elegance, yet all with your favorite Vervia trim, in cool NOCHE black: the practical, expanding shoulder bag, the delicate evening bag and the new classy shopping bag that you would be glad to be seen in City Supermarket with. For those who have kids, or remain kid's at heart, there are three brand, spanking new travel game sets; one which boasts more than 4 games in one, and will keep you well-occupied on your long haul flights.<br>
              <br>
            Not to be underestimated, in the coming heat is the new collection of Vervia hats, named VERSICAP. And that's not all to expect from Vervia this Summer. An additional new line of accessoirs, T-shirts and gift cards is destined to appear any moment: as soon Vervia's Swiss designer gets back from the Alps.</p>
          <p>All Vervia's artful furnishings, furniture and giftware were designed by Vervia's design team. Everything down to the modern, Ming stainless shelves can be purchased or made to order. Vervia's designers, mystical collaborators and magicians hail from all around the globe: from the furthest corner of Iceland to the bustling-hubub of Los Angeles. Vervia 每 live to be inspired!</p>
