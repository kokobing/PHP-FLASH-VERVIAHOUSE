        <p> </p>
        <p>Vervia exhibits their QBIT soft-furnishing cubes on the 100% Design Shanghai Preview exhibition to hit the Shanghai design scene with yet another innovation.<br>
          <br>
        QBIT is one of the signature innovations of Vervia. The cubes pretty much reflect our modern lifestyles, where mobility, flexibility and creativity is always required. The QBITS can be mixed and matched to fit any purpose in the home; they can become a cosy sitting area, a bed, a sofa a separation wall or simply a colourful decorative arrangement. Basically, a collection of cubes can become anything you like - the only limit is your imagination. Iris Hreinsdottir, member of the Vervia team says: 'The QBIT cubes are there for spontaneous living. Just as life is constantly changing, the cubes can be shifted around and adapted to various situations. Arranging the cubes is like a creative play where you discover new solutions and possibilities'.<br>
        <br>
        Vervia is an innovative lifestyle design house focusing on the organic, natural and spiritual elements of life. Vervia offers a totally fresh lifestyle vision for today and the future. While mixing visual concepts from ancient cultures with contemporary ideas, Vervia strives to bring a vivid energy and natural balance to people¡¯s homes and life.</p>
        <p>The event will take place from the 15-16 June at Z58 on Panyu Road, a design gallery designed by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, set to become an increasingly popular space for design and art exhibitions in Shanghai. This year's preview event will be co-hosted with a cocktail party together with Design Republic at the fifth-floor Gallery at 5 on the Bund, bringing together exhibitors, media, and designers to give a glimpse of things to come.</p>
        <p>The 100% Design Shanghai Preview will give the Shanghai audience a glimpse of things to come: an exclusive selection of companies and exhibitors that will also exhibit on the 100% Design Shanghai in 2008. </p>
